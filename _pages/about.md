<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Greetings! It is a great pleasure to welcome you here. I am currently an AI Research Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>, a leading AI research company in Vietnam. Here, I have the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ">Toan Tran</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ&hl/">Anh Tran</a>. Prior to this, I received my Engineer degree in Information Technology from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> (HUST) in Vietnam in 2023.

My primary research interests focus on deep generative models, with a particular emphasis on Diffusion Models. Additionally, I am deeply involved in the field of Trustworthy AI, where I concentrate on mitigating memorization issues in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models and developing defenses against Membership Inference Attacks in these models.
