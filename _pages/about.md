I am currently a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I am advised by Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkEXTbIAAAAJ">Vishal M. Patel</a>. My research focuses on computer vision, multimodal learning, and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on generative models.

Previously, I was an AI Research Intern at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence">Qualcomm AI Research</a> in Vietnam, where I had the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ">Toan Tran</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ&hl/">Anh Tran</a>. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> (HUST) in Vietnam in 2023, where I graduated with the highest GPA in my graduating class.
