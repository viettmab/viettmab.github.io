Greetings! It is a great pleasure to welcome you here. I am currently an AI Research Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>, a leading AI research company in Vietnam. Here, I have the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=PnwSuNMAAAAJ">Toan Tran</a> and Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ&hl/">Anh Tran</a>. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a> (HUST) in Vietnam in 2023, where I graduated with the highest GPA in my graduating class.

My primary research interests focus on computer vision, multimodal learning and machine learning, particularly generative models. Additionally, I am deeply involved in the field of Trustworthy AI, where I concentrate on mitigating memorization issues in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models and developing defenses against Membership Inference Attacks in these models.
